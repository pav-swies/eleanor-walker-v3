A fine merino wool handwoven blanket. Created by sewing five woven panels together by hand, drawing on the concept of 'hands on, minds off', slow textiles and mindfulness. Inspired by the word and feelings around 'hope', with fresh and bright colours, as a reminder of the times and seasons to come - of spring and summer, growth and warmth.
